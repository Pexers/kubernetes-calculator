# Kubernetes Calculator ðŸ§®
The Calculator application takes advantage of a microservice architecture to provide an API that solves mathematical expressions. The available microservices are the _addition_, _subtraction_, _multiplication_ and _division_.

Additionally, a [CI/CD pipeline](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml) was built with the help of GitHub Actions in order to automate the integration of software changes quickly and reliably into a Kubernetes Cluster deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline was divided into 3 stages:
1. `npm-test`: unit test the latest code code changes using NPM and _mocha_.
    ```sh
    $ npm run test
    > mocha services/**/test/*.js

    addition
        âœ” 2 + 2 should be 4 
    division
        âœ” 4 / 2 should be 2 
    multiplication
        âœ” 2 * 2 should be 4 
    subtraction
        âœ” 1 - 1 should be 0
    ```
2. `push-to-docker-hub`: build & push microservices images to Docker Hub using _docker-compose_.
3. `deploy-to-aks`: deploy the latest version of the application to an AKS cluster using Azure CLI and _kubectl_. 

Deployment configurations for Pods and Services can be found in the form of YAML files inside the [_pods_](pods) directory.

_Kubernetes Cluster services_:
```sh
$ kubectl get services

Services:

```
